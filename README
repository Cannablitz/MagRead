MagRead is an application for the Nokia N900 phone to read magnetic stripe
cards.

Requirements:
 - A hardware audio dongle to read the cards, such as those provided by Square
   for their payment service.
 - Qt 4.6 or later (including Qt Multimedia plugin)
 - Pulseaudio (default on Maemo)

It may run on any device meeting the above requirements, but has only been
tested on the N900 using Maemo5 PR1.2 and PR1.3.

To build on the terminal, simply run:
qmake && make

You may also open the project file in Qt Creator to build.


A packaged version of this is currently available on the Maemo extras-devel
repository at:
http://maemo.org/packages/view/magread/
