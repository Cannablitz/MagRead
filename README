MagRead is an application to read magnetic stripe cards.

Requirements:
 - A hardware audio dongle to read the cards, such as those provided by Square
   for their payment service.
 - Qt 4.6 or later (including Qt Multimedia plugin)

It may run on any device meeting the above requirements, but has only been
tested on a Linux desktop machine, a Nokia N8 and a Nokia N900.

To build on the terminal, simply run:
qmake && make

You may also open the project file in Qt Creator to build.


A packaged version of this is currently available on the Maemo extras-devel
repository at:
